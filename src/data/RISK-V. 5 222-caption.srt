00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,587
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:05,703
So far, we’ve explored what Enterprise Risk Management is, how

3
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:13,314
Internal Audit fits into the ‘Three Lines of Defense,’ and the
essential components that make an ERM framework effective.

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:21,442
In this module, we’ll shift our focus outward—to understand the
evolving risk landscape that organizations must navigate today.

5
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,580
We’ll examine the key global risk drivers shaping modern business

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,082
environments and unpack how risks can be categorized to support
clearer analysis and decision-making.

7
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:36,497
"The sources emphasize that uncertainty and risks are 'here to stay.'

8
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:40,165
In fact, they are a constant feature of the modern business

9
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:44,206
landscape. The ability of leaders to be agile in navigating this

10
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:48,621
uncertainty significantly increases an organization's capacity to

11
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:53,186
'pivot when the unexpected occurs,' allowing them
to adapt and survive.

12
00:00:53,186 --> 00:01:00,820
The sources highlight several key global risk drivers that are
shaping the environment organizations operate in today:

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,078
Cultural shifts in workforce and society: This includes evolving

14
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:12,604
employee expectations, societal values, and demographic changes that
impact talent, operations, and reputation.

15
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:20,891
Lynn Fountain also speaks to the importance of people and culture,
recognizing them as top priorities for Boards and Executives.

16
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:28,722
She also highlights how staffing models and team dynamics are
impacted by organizational culture and employee turnover.

17
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:33,220
Sustained inflation and high interest rates: These macroeconomic

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:42,610
factors can severely restrict growth opportunities, impact profit
margins, and necessitate new financial skills within an organization.

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,266
Geopolitical risks and regulations: Global political instability,

20
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,684
trade wars, and an ever-increasing complex web of regulations can

21
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:56,971
significantly affect business operations, supply
chains, and market access.

22
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:01,390
Fountain frequently discusses the impact of regulatory changes,

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,151
especially Sarbanes-Oxley, on internal audit
functions and the need for compliance.

24
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:11,096
This reinforces the significant impact regulations have.

25
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:15,781
Technology innovation: While offering immense opportunities, rapid

26
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:24,526
technological advancements also bring risks related to adoption,
integration, ethical implications, and the need for new skills.

27
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:28,820
Supply chain disruptions: Global events, natural disasters, or

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,427
geopolitical tensions can severely impact supply chains, leading to

29
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:38,580
production delays, increased costs, and inability
to meet customer demands.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,861
Employee attrition and layoffs: High turnover rates and workforce

31
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:49,847
reductions can impact productivity, morale, institutional knowledge,
and the ability to execute strategy.

32
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:54,203
This ties directly into Fountain's emphasis on talent acquisition,

33
00:02:54,203 --> 00:03:02,616
development, and retention, which she identifies as a significant
challenge for internal audit teams and organizations broadly..

34
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,994
In summary, today’s organizations operate in an environment where

35
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:11,602
uncertainty is constant and global risk drivers—from cultural shifts

36
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:19,360
and inflation to geopolitical tensions, technology disruption, and
talent challenges—are shaping daily realities.

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,581
For leaders and teams, recognizing these drivers is essential to
build agility and resilience.
